## [8.0.0] - 2017-10-15

### Changed

- `neo4j-rake_tasks` gem is no longer a dependency for `neo4j-core`.  Because many people don't use it, and because many people don't understand it, it will now need to be explicitly required for your project

### Added

- Allow configuration of timeout in Bolt adaptor

## [7.2.3] - 2017-08-22

### Added

- `start_node_neo_id` and `end_node_neo_id` on `Neo4j::Core::Relationship` objects (see #298 / thanks @klobuczek)

## [7.1.0] - 2017-04-27

### Fixed

- Changed default adaptor for HTTP adaptor in new API to use `typhoeus` rather than `net-http-persistent` because it has shown itself to be more stable under higher load

### Fixed

- Guard against `nil` value (thanks @WardCunningham / see #293)

## [7.0.8] - 2017-03-16

## [7.0.2] - 2016-12-28

### Fixed

- `Neo4j::Core::CypherSession::ConnectionFailedError` raised on requests to Neo4j (not just on connections)

## [7.0.1] - 2016-12-23

### Added

- `after_commit` hooks for transactions (see #277 / thanks @ProGM)

### Fixed

- When requests for constraints and indexes return an error, it is now raised as a Ruby exception (see https://github.com/neo4jrb/devise-neo4j/issues/27 and https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j/issues/1334)

### Changed

- The `Query#set` and `Query#remove` methods now support setting labels (either via `Symbol`s or `Array`s)

(There are probably other changes too!)

**Changes above this point should conform to [http://keepachangelog.com/]**

## [v4.1.0]
* A lot of work working with rubocop to clean up code
* Many instances of using strings were changed to use symbols
* Certain query responses are now automatically retried
* `Neo4j::Core::Query` changes
* WHERE clauses from `Query` chains are now surrounded by parentheses to avoid problems
* WHERE clauses now support Arrays and `nil` values for labels
* WHERE clauses with strings now support a second argument for parameters.  Examples:
  * `where("foo = {bar}", bar: value)`)
  * `where("foo = ?", value)`)
* REMOVE clauses now quote labels and support arrays to specify all labels
and properties for one variable
* RETURN clauses now turn `:neo_id` into `ID(var)`
* New method `#clause?` lets you determine if a `Query` object had a
clause called upon it in the past
* New method `#count` lets you query a count of a variable


## [v4.0.0]
This release focuses mostly on performance and security.
* Fixed a few n+1 queries, force the use of params in more common locations.
* The CypherTransaction class was heavily refactored to improve the number of database connections required per transaction. This may be considered a breaking API change. Using `Neo4j::Transaction.new` or `Neo4j::Transaction.run` as instructed in all docs and examples protects the user from this, so there should be no changes required to old code in most cases.
* New Rake task: `neo4j:start_no_wait` -- thanks, @telzul!
* Massive refactoring and general cleanup by Brian.

## [3.1.1]
* Force more basic, common queries to use params. Early benchmarks suggest big performance improvements.
* Auth improvements. You can now use a valid Neo4j token with any username to authenticate.

## [3.1.0]
* Swapped out `START n=node...` for `MATCH (n) WHERE ID(n)...` for compatibility with Neo4j 2.2.
* Added a new class, CypherAuthentication, to support Neo4j 2.2's new authentication endpoint.
* Modified the `neo4j:install` rake task to disable authentication in Neo4j 2.2.
* New rake tasks that do exactly what you expect: `neo4j:enable_auth`, `neo4j:disable_auth`, `neo4j:change_password`. All 2.2 only, of course.
* Travis-CI will run against its MRI specs against Neo4j 2.2 with Ruby 2.1.5.
* Use params for all `create` actions to improve performance and security.
* More tweaks to the string escaping process.
* Mild refactoring for DRY and performance.

## [3.0.8]
* Small bugfix. Releasing so neo4jrb/neo4j doesn't need to pull from master in its new release.

## [3.0.7]
* Move improved escaping of Cypher params

## [3.0.6]
* When using Neo4j >= 2.1.5, use the metadata keys in Cypher responses to find labels when loading nodes
* Adds `version` method to Embedded and Server sessions
* Improved escaping of Cypher params

## [3.0.5]
* Bug fix: automatic parsing of basic auth params in URL (Thanks, Miha Rekar!)
* Adds find_in_batches method, see github wiki for documentation: https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j-core/wiki

## [3.0.4]
* Bug fixes to sanitize params and remove blank clauses

## [3.0.3]
* Adds a user agent string to connections to identify the driver with the server

## [3.0.2]
* Improved detection of transaction responses to prevent conflicts with property names

## [3.0.1]
* Improved handling of cypher responses, particularly within transactions
